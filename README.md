picimo is a visual art front-end project containing several javascript &or; typescript packages and demos
loosely based on realtime 2d &and; 3d sprite rendering concepts and techniques using webgl / [three.js](https://threejs.org)

| [`legendary-mazes`](packages/legendary-mazes/) | a maze generation library |
| [`tiled-maps-demo`](packages/tiled-maps-demo/) | an experimental tiled-maps demo (renders 2d maps exported by [tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/)) |
